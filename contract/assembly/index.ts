// /*
//  * This is an example of an AssemblyScript smart contract with two simple,
//  * symmetric functions:
//  *
//  * 1. setGreeting: accepts a greeting, such as "howdy", and records it for the
//  *    user (account_id) who sent the request
//  * 2. getGreeting: accepts an account_id and returns the greeting saved for it,
//  *    defaulting to "Hello"
//  *
